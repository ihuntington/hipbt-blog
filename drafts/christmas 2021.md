# Christmas 2021

- Attempted to get back into the project
- Decided to add artist and album covers:
  - Made a start on doing this for artists chart
  - Used Catbox and Redis for storing Spotify artists requests
  - While fairly simple to add it was enjoyable
  - Good blog post on the cache: https://www.oscarfunes.com/2020/04/25/hapi-cache
- Did some reading on the 8-point grid: https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid
- Learned how to use Figma a little more
- Figma ref: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows#h_01F1ZKBDKC6KA06QJF6EA24EGQ
